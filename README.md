  For my redesign project, I chose Instagram, one of the most widely used mobile apps for sharing photos, videos, and connecting with people. I focused on improving its UI/UX to address a specific pain point that many users face—there is no easy way to find past interactions beyond just likes, comments, and tags. For example, if a user accidentally skips or forgets to save an informative or interesting post, there’s no quick way to go back and find it unless they remember the exact profile or keyword. This can be frustrating, especially when the content was useful or important.

To solve this problem, I redesigned the Instagram interface by adding a new “History” feature under the “Your Activity” section. In real Instagram, this section already includes Likes, Comments, and Tags, but I added “History” to give users a clearer and complete view of everything they’ve interacted with. This includes all the posts they’ve seen or engaged with, not just the ones they liked or commented on.

I then designed a simple and user-friendly UI for the History section. It looks similar to Instagram’s existing style, so users won’t find it hard to use. At the top of the History page, I added filters that allow users to sort their past interactions. They can choose to view posts from “Today,” or select “All Dates” to go back further. I also included an “All Content Types” filter to help users narrow down their search—whether they are looking for reels, images, or videos.

This new History feature is very helpful in real situations. For example, if someone is scrolling through Instagram and they quickly move past an educational or inspiring post without liking or saving it, they can later go to the History section and find it easily. This improves the overall experience by saving time and reducing frustration.

I also kept the interface very clean and organized. Each history item is shown with a preview image, so users can recognize the post instantly. When they tap on the post, it opens the original content, making it easy to revisit and interact again if needed.

The design adds a smart and simple improvement to Instagram’s usability. It doesn’t change the main layout of the app, so current users can adjust quickly. But it fills a clear gap in the platform by giving users more control and access to their past activity. It also keeps Instagram more engaging, as people can go back and re-explore things they found useful or interesting.
